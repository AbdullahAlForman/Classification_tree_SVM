# Classification Analysis with Decision Trees and SVM  
**A Comprehensive Guide for Machine Learning Classification Tasks**

## üåü **Overview**  
This repository contains a detailed Jupyter Notebook designed to explore and implement classification techniques using **Decision Trees** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. With a focus on accuracy and interpretability, this project demonstrates the step-by-step process of handling a classification problem from preprocessing to model evaluation.

## üìÇ **Key Features**  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  Includes cleaning, encoding, and splitting the dataset to prepare for machine learning.  

- **Decision Tree Classifier**:  
  Implementation of interpretable tree-based models with parameter tuning and visualization.  

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:  
  Utilizes kernel tricks and hyperparameter optimization to classify complex datasets effectively.  

- **Visualization**:  
  Comprehensive plots to visualize decision boundaries, feature importance, and model comparisons.  

- **Performance Metrics**:  
  Analysis of precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to assess model quality.
